The workshop is divided into 10 steps. Each step builds on the previous one, adding new features and functionality.</p> <p>We start from the base functionality (step 1) and add features in the subsequent steps. The result after each step is located in a separate directory (<code>step-XX</code>). The final solution is in the <code>step-09</code> directory.</p> <p>We recommend to start by checking out the main branch and then opening the project from <code>step-01</code> in your IDE and using that directory throughout the workshop. The other option is to make a copy of it. If you later need to reset to a particular step, either overwrite your working directory with the directory for the step you want to reset to, or, in your IDE, open the project from the step directory you want to reset to.</p>"},{"location":"#lets-get-started","title":"Let\u2019s get started!","text":"<p>Go to the requirements page to prepare for the workshop.

It actually can interact with any model serving the OpenAI API (like vLLM or Podman AI Lab). Quarkus LangChain4j abstracts the complexity of calling the model and provides a simple API to interact with it.</p> <p>In our case, the application is a simple chatbot. It uses a WebSocket, this is why you can also see the following dependency in the <code>pom.xml</code> file:</p> <pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n    &lt;groupId&gt;io.quarkus&lt;/groupId&gt;\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;quarkus-websockets-next&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>If you now open the <code>src/main/java/dev/langchain4j/quarkus/workshop/CustomerSupportAgentWebSocket.java</code>  file, you can see how the web socket is implemented:</p> CustomerSupportAgentWebSocket.java<pre><code>package dev.langchain4j.quarkus.workshop;\n\nimport io.quarkus.websockets.next.OnOpen;\nimport io.quarkus.websockets.next.OnTextMessage;\nimport io.quarkus.websockets.next.WebSocket;\n\n@WebSocket(path = \"/customer-support-agent\")\npublic class CustomerSupportAgentWebSocket {\n\n    private final CustomerSupportAgent customerSupportAgent;\n\n    public CustomerSupportAgentWebSocket(CustomerSupportAgent customerSupportAgent) {\n        this.customerSupportAgent = customerSupportAgent;\n    }\n\n    @OnOpen\n    public String onOpen() {\n        return \"Welcome to Miles of Smiles!

An AI service is an object managed by the Quarkus LangChain4j extension. It models the interaction with the AI model. As you can see it\u2019s an interface, not a concrete class, so you don\u2019t need to implement anything (thanks Quarkus!). Quarkus LangChain4j will provide an implementation for you at build time. Thus, your application only interacts with the methods defined in the interface.</p> <p>There is a single method in this interface, <code>chat</code>, but you could name the method whatever you wanted. It takes a user message as input (as it\u2019s the only parameter, we consider it to be the user message) and returns the response from the AI model. How this is done is abstracted away by Quarkus LangChain4j.</p> <p><code>SessionScoped</code>?</p> <p>Attentive readers might have noticed the <code>@SessionScoped</code> annotation. This is a CDI annotation which scopes the object to the session. In our case the session is the web socket. The session starts when the user connects to the web socket and ends when the user disconnects. This annotation indicates that the <code>CustomerSupportAgent</code> object is created when the session starts and destroyed when the session ends. It influences the memory of our chatbot, as it remembers the conversation that happened so far in this session.</p> <p>So far, so good!

You can then tie these traces back to specific log entries or lines in your code.</p> <p>Tracing can also help you detect anomalies in the behavior of your application over time, such as a sudden increase in traffic or a drop in response times.</p> <p>Quarkus implements the OpenTelemetry project for tracing capabilities, allowing you to collect and analyze  trace data from your LangChain4j application. You can use the OpenTelemetry API to send traces to a tracing service such as Jaeger, Zipkin, or Tempo, which can then be used for monitoring and debugging purposes.</p> <p>To add OpenTelemetry (and by extension tracing) to your application, you will need to add the opentelemetry extensions to your pom.xml file. You can optionally also add the opentelemetry-jdbc dependency to collect  trace data from JDBC queries.</p> pom.xml<pre><code>        &lt;dependency&gt;\n            &lt;groupId&gt;io.quarkus&lt;/groupId&gt;\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;quarkus-opentelemetry&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\n            &lt;groupId&gt;io.opentelemetry.instrumentation&lt;/groupId&gt;\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;opentelemetry-jdbc&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>By adding these extensions to your applications, Quarkus does a lot of heavy lifting for you in terms of setting up and configuring the OpenTelemetry API, including sending traces to a tracing service. Quarkus LangChain4j automatically integrates with the OpenTelemetry extension to collect traces regarding your interactions with LLMs as well.</p> <p>You can configure the opentelemetry tracing functionality by e.g. setting the endpoint and headers for your tracing service, as well as the format of the traces:</p> <pre><code># quarkus.otel.exporter.otlp.traces.endpoint=http://localhost:4317\nquarkus.otel.exporter.otlp.traces.headers=authorization=Bearer my_secret \nquarkus.log.console.format=%d{HH:mm:ss} %-5p traceId=%X{traceId}, parentId=%X{parentId}, spanId=%X{spanId}, sampled=%X{sampled} [%c{2.}] (%t) %s%e%n  \n# enable tracing db requests\nquarkus.datasource.jdbc.telemetry=true\n</code></pre> <p>You might notice in the above example that the traces endpoint is commented out. If you have a tracing service running, you can set the endpoint accordingly. In a production environment you will likely override this value with an environment variable or ConfigMap or something similar. In our case however, we\u2019re going to use a Quarkus Dev Service to capture and visualize the traces, as well as logs and metrics.</p>"},{"location":"step-09/#tools-to-visualize-your-collected-observability-data-on-your-local-machine","title":"Tools to visualize your collected observability data on your local machine","text":"<p>In production, your organization will likely already have tools set up to collect observability data, however Quarkus offers a few ways to visualize and search the collected data on your local machine.</p>"},{"location":"step-09/#quarkus-otel-lgtm-dev-service","title":"Quarkus Otel LGTM Dev Service","text":"<p>Quarkus provides an experimental new Dev Service to help visualize all your OpenTelemetry observability data in a central place.

By adding the <code>quarkus-observability-devservices-lgtm</code> extension, this set of tools will automatically (or may we say \u2018automagically\u2019?) start up in their respective containers and wire up to your application\u2019s observability endpoints.</p> <p>Add the following dependencies in your <code>pom.xml</code>:</p> pom.xml<pre><code>        &lt;dependency&gt;\n            &lt;groupId&gt;io.quarkus&lt;/groupId&gt;\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;quarkus-observability-devservices-lgtm&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n            &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>In the application.properties, let\u2019s enable the OpenTelemetry tracing and log collection features:</p> <pre><code>quarkus.otel.logs.enabled=true\nquarkus.otel.traces.enabled=true\n# Disable LTGM in test mode\n%test.quarkus.observability.enabled=false\n</code></pre> <p>Now refresh the chatbot application in your browser and interact with the bot again to generate some new observability data. Note that it could take a bit longer for the application to start up, since Quarkus is starting up the LGTM Dev Services containers in the background.</p> <p>After you\u2019ve generated some data, let\u2019s go and explore this data in Grafana. The Dev Service exposes a random port. The easiest way to find it is to go to the Quarkus Dev UI (http://localhost:8080/q/dev-ui) and click on the \u201cDev Services\u201d menu item.</p> <p></p> <p>Find the <code>grafana.endpoint</code> and open the url in another browser tab.

You will notice 2 dashboards, one for OTLP and one for Prometheus. Remember how we added both the Micrometer OpenTelemetry and Prometheus registry extensions? They\u2019re both reflected here. Feel free to explore the dashboards. If you don\u2019t see much data data in the graphs, you may want to select a shorter time span in the top right of your screen and/or create some more chat requests.</p> <p></p> <p>You can also find an aggregation of all metrics (including the LangChain4j relevant ones) by going to Explore &gt; Metrics:</p> <p></p> <p>Now let\u2019s explore the Query functionality to find specific data. Click on the <code>Explore</code> menu item. An interactive query window will open up. Next to \u201cOutline\u201d you\u2019ll see that Prometheus is selected in the dropdown. Select <code>gen_ai_client_estimated_cost_total</code>. Then, in label filters, select <code>currency</code> and value <code>USD</code>. Finally, click the Run query button to see the results. You should see an estimated cost aggregation of the latest calls to the model. This is an experimental feature based on what typical calls to ChatGPT cost.</p> <p></p> <p>Let\u2019s now take a look at how we can get our traces from Tempo. In the same Query window next the \u201cOutline\u201d, select <code>Tempo</code> instead of Prometheus. Then, click on <code>Search</code> next to Query type. You will see a table appear below with a list of the latest trace IDs and the service they relate to.</p> <p></p> <p>Click on any one of the traces to open more details about them. You will see a list of spans that represent different parts of the request and response, and potentially also the database query, based on which trace you have selected. Go ahead and explore these traces and spans for a little while to get familiar with the data that\u2019s automatically tracked when enabling the OpenTelemetry extension. Make sure to also click on the <code>Node Graph</code> to see the flow of the request.</p> <p>Finally, expand one (or more) of the span elements. You will see details about a particular call in the code, and you\u2019ll also see a button \u201cLogs for this span\u201d. This allows you to see the logs related to that particular span.

You can optionally also add the opentelemetry-jdbc dependency to collect  trace data from JDBC queries.</p> pom.xml<pre><code>        &lt;dependency&gt;\n            &lt;groupId&gt;io.quarkus&lt;/groupId&gt;\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;quarkus-opentelemetry&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\n            &lt;groupId&gt;io.opentelemetry.instrumentation&lt;/groupId&gt;\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;opentelemetry-jdbc&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>By adding these extensions to your applications, Quarkus does a lot of heavy lifting for you in terms of setting up and configuring the OpenTelemetry API, including sending traces to a tracing service. Quarkus LangChain4j automatically integrates with the OpenTelemetry extension to collect traces regarding your interactions with LLMs as well.</p> <p>You can configure the opentelemetry tracing functionality by e.g. setting the endpoint and headers for your tracing service, as well as the format of the traces:</p> <pre><code># quarkus.otel.exporter.otlp.traces.endpoint=http://localhost:4317\nquarkus.otel.exporter.otlp.traces.headers=authorization=Bearer my_secret \nquarkus.log.console.format=%d{HH:mm:ss} %-5p traceId=%X{traceId}, parentId=%X{parentId}, spanId=%X{spanId}, sampled=%X{sampled} [%c{2.}] (%t) %s%e%n  \n# enable tracing db requests\nquarkus.datasource.jdbc.telemetry=true\n</code></pre> <p>You might notice in the above example that the traces endpoint is commented out. If you have a tracing service running, you can set the endpoint accordingly. In a production environment you will likely override this value with an environment variable or ConfigMap or something similar. In our case however, we\u2019re going to use a Quarkus Dev Service to capture and visualize the traces, as well as logs and metrics.</p>"},{"location":"step-10/#tools-to-visualize-your-collected-observability-data-on-your-local-machine","title":"Tools to visualize your collected observability data on your local machine","text":"<p>In production, your organization will likely already have tools set up to collect observability data, however Quarkus offers a few ways to visualize and search the collected data on your local machine.</p>"},{"location":"step-10/#quarkus-otel-lgtm-dev-service","title":"Quarkus Otel LGTM Dev Service","text":"<p>Quarkus provides an experimental new Dev Service to help visualize all your OpenTelemetry observability data in a central place.

The Dev Service exposes a random port. The easiest way to find it is to go to the Quarkus Dev UI (http://localhost:8080/q/dev-ui) and click on the \u201cDev Services\u201d menu item.</p> <p></p> <p>Find the <code>grafana.endpoint</code> and open the url in another browser tab.

You will notice 2 dashboards, one for OTLP and one for Prometheus. Remember how we added both the Micrometer OpenTelemetry and Prometheus registry extensions? They\u2019re both reflected here. Feel free to explore the dashboards. If you don\u2019t see much data data in the graphs, you may want to select a shorter time span in the top right of your screen and/or create some more chat requests.</p> <p></p> <p>You can also find an aggregation of all metrics (including the LangChain4j relevant ones) by going to Explore &gt; Metrics:</p> <p></p> <p>Now let\u2019s explore the Query functionality to find specific data. Click on the <code>Explore</code> menu item. An interactive query window will open up. Next to \u201cOutline\u201d you\u2019ll see that Prometheus is selected in the dropdown. Select <code>gen_ai_client_estimated_cost_total</code>. Then, in label filters, select <code>currency</code> and value <code>USD</code>. Finally, click the Run query button to see the results. You should see an estimated cost aggregation of the latest calls to the model. This is an experimental feature based on what typical calls to ChatGPT cost.</p> <p></p> <p>Let\u2019s now take a look at how we can get our traces from Tempo. In the same Query window next the \u201cOutline\u201d, select <code>Tempo</code> instead of Prometheus. Then, click on <code>Search</code> next to Query type. You will see a table appear below with a list of the latest trace IDs and the service they relate to.</p> <p></p> <p>Click on any one of the traces to open more details about them. You will see a list of spans that represent different parts of the request and response, and potentially also the database query, based on which trace you have selected. Go ahead and explore these traces and spans for a little while to get familiar with the data that\u2019s automatically tracked when enabling the OpenTelemetry extension. Make sure to also click on the <code>Node Graph</code> to see the flow of the request.</p> <p>Finally, expand one (or more) of the span elements. You will see details about a particular call in the code, and you\u2019ll also see a button \u201cLogs for this span\u201d. This allows you to see the logs related to that particular span.
